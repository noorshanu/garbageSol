          <p>
            Once upon a crypto-calamity, a man (james Howells) nonchalantly
            tossed 16,000 Bitcoins into the garbage, deeming them worthless.
            Little did he know, his trash became a treasure as those discarded
            Bitcoins now sparkle with a value in the millions. Moral of the
            story: Never underestimate the magic of crypto dust!
